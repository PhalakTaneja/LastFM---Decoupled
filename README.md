A Python data pipeline that fetches your Last.fm listening history, cleans and stores it in a MySQL database, and generates custom Spotify playlists. 🎵

After cloning the repo, run the server.py first and then run client.py in a different terminal.

P.S. -  The feature of making a playlist out of your top 'scrobbles' is redacted for now. Don't be sad it'll be back :)
